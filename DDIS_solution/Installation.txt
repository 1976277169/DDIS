add env variables (change the content according to the specific computer):
	* OPENCV2 = D:\ToolKits\opencv_2.4.12\build

	* MATLAB_ROOT = C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2014b

add to path: 
	%OPENCV2%\x64\vc12\bin

Change the build configuration to x64 in visual studio's configuration manager:
	Open the solution, go to solution properties --> Configuration Properties --> Configuration
